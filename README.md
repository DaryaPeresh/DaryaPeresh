Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Darya. I live in the small town of Pinsk in the south of Belarus. 
Here she graduated from high school and entered the Belarusian State Economic University in Minsk. 
I am raising my teenage daughter on my own. 
I worked in the field of hospitality and tourism, in sales, and now I decided to fulfill my dream and start my journey in IT.
I love positivity and live with positivity. I love learning something new every day. I adore animals (but in general, I am the mother of all homeless cats) 
In people I appreciate kindness, humanity, responsibility, decency, since I myself am so thanks to my military dad. I believe in a bright future and my success in it.
All the best!)
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, I'm happy to help)
